# LLM-Benchmark-Logs

Welcome to the LLM-Benchmark-Logs repository. This repository is dedicated to documenting and organizing benchmarks performed on various Foundational Large Language Models and their Fine-tunes. 

The main content of this repository is plaintext files containing detailed benchmark results. These files provide a comprehensive record of the performance characteristics of different LLMs under various conditions and workloads.

In the future, I may introduce a "leaderboard" feature, which will rank the LLMs based on their benchmark performance. This will provide a quick and easy reference for comparing the capabilities of different LLMs. However, I don't want to be in the business of leaderboards, so don't expect much.
